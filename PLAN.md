# CleanUpTool GUI Plan

## Current Goals
- Provide a cross-platform GUI for scanning directories.
- Display files sorted by size so large files are easy to locate.
- Allow users to open the file's location in their operating system's file explorer.
- Enable optional deletion of files directly from the interface.

## Possible Future Enhancements
- Integrate existing cleanup features (extension filtering, empty directory removal) into the GUI.
- Show folder sizes and allow drilling down into directories.
- Provide search and filtering by file type or name.
- Detect and manage duplicate files.
- Schedule automated cleanup tasks.
